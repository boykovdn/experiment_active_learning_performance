## Aim

Experiment aiming to compare performance of active learning (AL) querying VS random subset selection. The expected result is that AL performance increases more rapidly. The experiment is carried out on generated Gaussian clusters and on images using Cellpose as feature extractor.

## Current state

TODO

## Running

Use docker and the run\_container.sh script. Uncomment the jupyter bit if you want to run a notebook on localhost:8008.
